# UX/UI Design Lecture
November 4, 2024

## Notes
- Most users give a time of 3 seconds to decide whether to continue on the site or click out
- Usability: Very important
- The easier for the person to use, the better
- Jacobs Law: Users spend most of their time on other sites, so that's where they form their expectations for how a webpage should work
- Website Organization: May want hierarchal for website
- 3 Click Rule: We don't want anything more than three clicks
- Responsive Design: website shoukd be able to accomodate user's screen size
- Browser Compatability: Webpages do not look the same in all major browsers
- Search Engine Optomization (SEO): Incorporate good web design and usability principles
- has SEO been tested? it sounds like it goes together to being at the top of the site but we have seen major websites using tons and tons of divs, Not many semantic tags
- Use Nelsons Heuristics: design Principles 

## Exercise
Our Website: https://www.007museum.com/

- Layout is everywhere
- Long text 
- Pictures are way too big
- No Navigation Control - it is one scrolling page
- Unclear on what is the ourpose of the website
- Text screenshots
- Borders that are meant to seperate section actually make eveyrthing more confusing
- Majority of the website in one page
